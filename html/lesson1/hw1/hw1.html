    The Simpson family consists of fictional characters featured in the animated television series The Simpsons. The
    Simpsons are a nuclear family consisting of married couple Homer and Marge and their three children Bart, Lisa, and
    Maggie. They live at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of Springfield, United States, and they were
    created by cartoonist Matt Groening, who conceived the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart"
    for his own name. The family debuted on Fox on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" and were
    later spun off into their own series, which debuted on Fox in the U.S. on December 17, 1989.
    Alongside the five main family members, there are a number of other major and minor characters in their family. The
    most commonly recurring characters are Homer's father Abraham "Grampa" Simpson; Marge's sisters Patty and Selma
    Bouvier; and the family's two pets, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II. Other family members include Homer's
    mother Mona Simpson, Homer's half-brother Herbert Powell, Marge's mother Jacqueline Bouvier, and other minor
    relatives.

    Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born April 1 or February 23) is the Deuteragonist of The Simpsons.
    Bart is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child. He is the
    only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo",
    after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical
    Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the

<p>
    Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9) is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the two
    tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.
    In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called Lil'
    Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of
    the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family.
    In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing
    saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity
    is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on
    her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ
    of 159.
